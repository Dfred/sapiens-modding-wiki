# Getting Started

## Installing

While it's technically possible to use Hammerstone from steam, it's highly recommended to install from GitHub. This will allow you to view the source code as you develop your own mod, and perhaps, maybe even contribute something of your own! You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/SirLich/hammerstone-framework).

Once you've downloaded the repository, you should locate it inside of your mods directory, e.g., `C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\majicjungle\sapiens\mods\hammerstone\`

## What next?

Hammerstone is a *framework*. The next steps for you depend entirely on what you're trying to create. Here are some systems you might want to explore:

 - Get started with logging with [Logger](logger.md).
 - Get started with UI with [UI Manager](ui-manager.md).
 - Get started with input with [Input Manager](input-manager.md)
 - Get started with game saves with [Save State Manager](save-state.md)
