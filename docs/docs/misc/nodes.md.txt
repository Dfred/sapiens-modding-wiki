This is in there, I don't what it means or what to do with it:

### Shadowing and Threading

Basically when the script is loaded, it is run. So when you declare that mod:onLoad function it is the same as saying mod.onLoad = function(self). You can do whatever you like there, and quite a few vanilla scripts do set up various state at that base level. I do kind of try to avoid it though, as you can't assume everything has been fully loaded at that point.

I'm not sure how you plan on structuring this for the multiple threads? buildable:addBuildable will need to be called from all, so if you do it this way without shadowing buildable, or solving it some other way, you'll need to do it in 3 places, instead of one.
