## How to use headers
Headers (`#, ##, ###, ####`) are used to section a page. 

`#` should ONLY be used once, and at the top for the title. 
`##` should be used for each 'topic', so things like 'Creating a model' or 'Example'
`###` should be used for each 'step' or part to a section. Like 'Importing a model' then 'Editing the model'
`####` should be used for further division of a section, but isn't super common

# Categories
## Guides
The guides sections are for walkthroughs to do a specific thing. For example, setting up a project or using a specific feature

## Documentation
The documentation contains specific pages on a part of the game. It can contain an example, but generally **doesn't** walk the reader through implementation.

### Visuals
This contains stuff for everything visual, like modelling but also UI.

### Scripting
This contains the 'behind the scenes' topics, like handling input or UI events. 

### Miscellaneous
This contains stuff that doesn't fit in any of the other categories

## Hammerstone
This contains the documentation for Hammerstone modules.
